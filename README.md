This is Repo Reaper's Bullet Journal! After the splash screen, you can enter a path to a .bujo file, 
and open your week view. You can create new Tasks and events, and it will appear in your week view.
The Task Queue bar on the right shows all your tasks and their completion status. The Notes section right
next to it is a place where you can write notes and load them later
You can even add hyperlinks into your descriptions to click and open in a browser. 
You can easily edit or delete events/tasks by clicking the buttons on each. 
You can change the theme by clicking the theme button. 
You can also see a progress bar for your tasks.
